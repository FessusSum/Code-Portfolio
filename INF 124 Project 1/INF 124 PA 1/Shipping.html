<h2><b>Placing an Order</b></h2>
To place an order, simply fill out the form at the bottom of the product's detail page. After you place an order, a sales associate will contact you with an invoice of your order including shipping fees.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><b>Accepted Payment Method</b></h2>
As of now, Project MOBIUS is only accepting credit card payment due to a recent influx of bounced checks and suitcases full of suspiciously acquired money. Payment must be made in full within seven days of the order invoice. Orders will be invoiced when all items in the order are ready to be shipped. All sales are final. No Refunds.

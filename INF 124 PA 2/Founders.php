<h2><b>Founders</b></h2>
Project MOBIUS was originally founded by three legendary aces of varying nationality. Disgusted with the way that soldiers were carelessly discarded over games of politics between world superpowers, they set out to break the tyrannical hold these nations had over the rest of the world.

<h3>Mobius 1</h3>

<p>Also known as the "Ribbon Fighter" for the Mobius strip adorning his signature F-22, Mobius 1 is an enigma. Despite his legendary combat feats, almost nothing is known about him. He spent most of his military career without a wingman, defeating scores of enemy pilots while hopelessly outnumbered time and time again. It is said that Mobius One alone could turn the tide of a war. Oddly enough, Mobius One would go on to suppressing an entire armed insurrection accompanied only by a single AWACS unit, proving the rumors correct once and for all. After single handedly defeating an insurrectionist group, Mobius One quietly retired from the armed forces and disappeared from public eye. Project MOBIUS marks his first appearance in several years. Unlike the other founders, Mobius 1 seems to work out of respect for the art of flying moreso than any political agenda. His piloting skills are matched only by his ceaseless dedication to making sure that every plane on offer by Project MOBIUS is of the highest quality. </p>

<h3>Blaze</h3>
<p>Also known as Razgriz 1, Blaze's military career was a tumultuous one. Originally a rookie pilot in the [REDACTED] Air Force, Blaze's squadron was one of many sent as a counteroffensive against [REDACTED]. Unfortunately, his nation's warmongering politicians conspired to prolong the war in an attempt to boost [REDACTED]'s flagging economy. As Blaze's squadron returned from victory after victory, his nation's leaders plotted to frame them for treason and execute them in order to prevent them from bring the war to an end. While Blaze and his fellow pilots eventually escaped the clutches of his own government, the callousness his leaders showed towards the lives of his fellow soldiers left a deep impression on him. He soon set out to find other aces to help him make sure that soldiers would never again be tossed away so cheaply, eventually founding Project MOBIUS. </p>

<h3>Cipher</h3>
<p>Also known as Galm 1, much of Cipher's life was spent as a mercenary. With his wingman Larry "Pixy" Foulke, Cipher carved a bloody path through multiple wars. His career as a mercenary soon came to a crashing halt during an engagement against the nation of [REDACTED], when guerilla fighters detonated several repurposed "Mother of all Bombs" on their own soil in an attempt to stall the advancing mercenaries. Already suffering from PTSD due to multiple recent engagements with [REDACTED] armed forces, "Pixy" turned on Cipher and attempted to kill him an an apparent murder/suicide attempt, citing the "madness that took hold of both nations". After damaging Pixy's left engine, Cipher was forced to watch his friend die as Pixy refused to eject from his doomed aircraft. Shamed, Cipher soon left his mercenary group and sought to find an end to the madness that is war, leading him to Project MOBIUS.
